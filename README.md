# BOM Data Scrapper
Python script that scrapes weather and climate data from the [Australian Bureau of Meterology](http://www.bom.gov.au/). 

While an effort has been made to make this platform independent, it has been designed and tested on Windows exclusively. 

## Requirements 
All Python environment requirements are listed in the `conda-env.yml` file for Conda use, a `requirements.txt` file is also included for venv

## Usage
On Windows, clone the repo and run the `run.bat` file, a venv with the neccersary dependencies will automatically be created and the script run.
